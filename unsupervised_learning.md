no defined output for each input. Instead, we find structure in the data (e.g.; generative models).

clustering is one instance of unsupervised learning. For example, Google news clusters relevant articles together.

non-clustering example is the cocktail party algorithm, where we find structure in a chaotic environment (e.g.; separating a voice and music from one audio file).

"With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results."

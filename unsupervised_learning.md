no defined output for each input. Instead, we find structure in the data (e.g.; generative models).

## clustering
" we just ask the algorithm find some structure in the data for us. Given this data set one type of structure we might have an algorithm find is that it looks like this data set has points grouped into two separate clusters and so an algorithm that finds clusters like the ones I've just circled is called a clustering algorithm."

non-clustering example is the cocktail party algorithm, where we find structure in a chaotic environment (e.g.; separating a voice and music from one audio file).

"With unsupervised learning there is no feedback based on the prediction results."

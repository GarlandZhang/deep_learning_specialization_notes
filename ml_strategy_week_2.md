## error analysis

suppose in your cat dog classifier, you have 90% accuracy. Of the 100 mislabelled images from the dev set, you notice 50 of them are dogs. Then you can focus on improving the dog portion of the classifier to potentially reduce the error from 10% to 5%.

## build your first system quickly, then iterate

- set up dev/test set and performance metric (e.g; mAp)
- build initial system quickly (worry about more specific things later)
  - e.g.; if building speech recognition example, dont focus on noisy background, accented speech, stuttering all at same time. do one thing

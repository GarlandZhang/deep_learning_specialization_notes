we need non-linear hypotheses for more complex problems.

e.g.; we want to perform classification on 100x100 images of cars/non-cars. To illustrate the relatinoship between pixels (aka features), we need to create new features such as quadratic features. However this blows up into millions of features, which is computationally expensive. 

Thus, to perform logistic regression with a linear hypothesis is too expensive.

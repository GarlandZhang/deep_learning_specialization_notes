in supervised learning, the dataset has a defined output for every input, so we learn to look for the relationship between x and y.

two categories: regression and classification.
  - regression: predict results with continuous output
    e.g.; calculating for house price given data about house sizes is a regression problem. 
  - classification: predict results with discrete output
